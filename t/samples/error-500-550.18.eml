mailing list memberships.  It includes your subscription info and how
to use it to change it or unsubscribe from a list.

configuration, including unsubscribing, setting digest-style delivery
or disabling delivery altogether (e.g., for a vacation), and so on.

changes.  For more info, send a message to the '-request' address of
the list (for example, mailman-request@mageia.org) containing just the

you with instructions.
