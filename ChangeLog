	* soap/sympasoap.pm: [reported by J.Schmalenbach]Fix: using
	  incorrect variable. Led to empty gecos while using SOAP add
	  method.

	* soap/sympasoap.pm: Added the following comment :
	  This test's purpose is to ensure that we are presented the right
	  cookie. In addition, we avoid the following problem: if the
	  cookie is composed of digits only ([0-9]) AND it starts with at
	  least one zero character, it is treated as a number and the
	  leading zeros are ignored. When tested against checksum, it is
	  not the same character string as the leading zeros are missing.
	  We add a number comparison to avoid it. Example: 00785136 becomes
	  785136.

	* soap/sympasoap.pm: Fix: Yet another ( better ) solution to remove

	* soap/sympasoap.pm: [Reported by P. David, univ. Strasbourg] Fix:
	  In some very rare occurences, the session identifier would be
	  constituted of decimal numbers only AND start with at least one
	  "0" (zero) character. In this case, this string was considered a
	  number by sympasoap.pm and the zero removed, thus shortening -
	  and invalidating - the id. This would prevent the user from being
	  authorized to see pages in the wiki.
