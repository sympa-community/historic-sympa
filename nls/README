To use FR or US or ES catalogue of Sympa you need to compile it :

-> edit Makefile to match your configuration

-> type :
>make

-> then
>make install

At run time if the version number of the nls catalog and the perl
source are different, sympa will not start. In these case check
the availibility of the latest nls catalog for the appropriated
language (http://listes.cru.fr/sympa/) else you may edit the nls
".msg" file and change the version number this's dangerous, usefull
only if you want to update some cxatalogs.

**************************************************************************

es.msg catalogue is a contribution from Alex Nappa (alex.nappa@imag.fr)
from Isoc France.

          You would like sympa to support some new language ?

 let's translate the existing nls and helpfile and submit it to
sympa authors. 

./check.pl can help you to check if your are introducing inconstencies
but first edit it to introduce the new .msg file.
