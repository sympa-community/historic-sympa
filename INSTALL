Please refer to the documentation for full installation notes : doc/sympa/node4.html

Installing Sympa from sources
=============================

Create a dedicated user sympa.sympa (and it's home directory and  run 

./configure; make; make install.  (you may have to use Gnu make).

If usefull, the make will propose that you upgrade some CPAN module.
In this case you'll need to be root.

If you get sources from cvs tree first run:

automake -a ; aclocal ; autoconf
   

Sympa setup
==========

1/ Customization of sympa.conf
You can edit sympa.conf (and wwsympa.conf) manually or run sympa_wizard.pl that will help
you create your configuration files.

2/ Database (MySQL) setup
db_xxx parameters in sympa.conf refer to your local database. 
Sympa.pl should be able to create this database at runtime ; if it does not you'll
have to create it yourself with the provided create_db.xxx scripts and provide
read access to Sympa.

3/ Mail aliases
Sympa will use a dedicated alias file for its own mail aliases, default is /etc/mail/sympa_aliases.
You have to configure your MTA (sendmail/postfix,...) to use this file.
You should also create the main Sympa aliases ; they will look like this :
	sympa: "| /home/sympa/bin/queue sympa@my.domain.org"
	listmaster: "| /home/sympa/bin/queue listmaster@my.domain.org"
	bounce+*: "| /home/sympa/bin/bouncequeue sympa@my.domain.org"
	sympa-request: postmaster
	sympa-owner: postmaster

Note that Sympa can also manage virtual mail domains (refer to documentation)
