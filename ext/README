The ext/ directory should become the top-level directory, where all
plugins live, as in the Perl-Core development tree.  It may also be
very useful to have separate github trees per plugin.

** TODO:

in ext/OAuth1
   add MANIFEST, ChangeLog, Makefile.PL, tests

in ext/OAuth2
   add MANIFEST, ChangeLog, Makefile.PL, tests

in ext/Plugin
   add MANIFEST, ChangeLog, Makefile.PL, tests

in ext/VOOT

in ext/NetVOOT
   add MANIFEST, ChangeLog, Makefile.PL, tests
   To be released on CPAN, usable for other projects than Sympa.
